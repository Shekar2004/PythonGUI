# PythonGUI
In this we had designed a **GUI using tkinter** which would have the following overall functionality:

    - The GUI would provide the user to select a file from the computer.
    - It will have a dropdown menu to toggle between two output options: Image Captioning and Image Classification
    - If Image Captioning is selected then it should show the caption for the selected image file along with the original image file side-by-side.
    - For Image Classification it should display the classification class instead of the captions.
